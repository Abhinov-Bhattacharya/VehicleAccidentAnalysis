# VehicleAccidentAnalysis
## Introduction

Road safety is a very important topic around the world. Each year thousands of accidents are 
reported to the police and details such as accident severity, location, date, weather, road 
conditions, and number of causalities is recorded. Aim of this project is to make roads safer 
for everyone by digging into common denominators and using visualization to make sense of 
the data.

Traffic accidents are...

* Cause of 1.35 million deaths globally in 2016.

* Main cause of death among those aged 15â€“29 years.

* Predicted to become the 7 the adding cause of death by 2030.

Predicting the accident severity in advance could be used to send the exact required staff and
equipment to the place of the accident, thus saving a significant amount of live search year.
Road safety should be a prior interest for governments, local authorities and private 
companies investing in technologies that can help reduce accidents and improve overall
driver safety.

## Pre Selected Features

This first notebook contains all the steps and transformations I performed for the feature selection. You can find the information on the raw data in the following kaggle page. The [kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016) contain an extended descriptions of different aspect of the accidents, thus I've selected the most relevant and useful data for my analysis.

## Design and flow of Models
Following are the modules in which we have divided are project:
* Forming the strategy for making prediction model and setting the definite approach.
* Analysing the data
* Visualizing the data using various types of graphs
* Creating a train and test dataset from the available data and making a feature 
extraction model.
* Implementing different ML models and algorithms and doing a comparative analysis 
to find out where the prediction is best.
